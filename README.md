Pong Game - (C#)

<p>This is a Pong Game that I have programmed using C# and Visual Studio!</p>
How Game Works...
<ul>  
  <li>Move your paddle by using the 'W' key for up and 'S' key for down in order to intercept the ball</li>
  <li>When you intercept the ball with the paddle, it'll bounce back in a direction that depends on where the ball hits on the paddle</li>
  <li>To score, try to hit the opponents wall, but if you miss the ball and you let the ball hit your wall, you lose a point</li>
  <li>Computer becomes more skilled (Fater) as game progresses</li>
</ul>
